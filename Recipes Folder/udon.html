    <h3 class="reci">Description</h3>
        <p class="thin slant">
            This delicious yaki udon stir-fry is similar to yakisoba, but it's made with thick, white udon noodles and tossed with a much simpler sauce. 
            Often used in soups, udon noodles are also delicious fried, the texture is just awesome because they are chewy. It's the best optione to cook at home when opting out of take-out.
